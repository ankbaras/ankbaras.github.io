Hi, I'm Ankit. I started out as a chemical engineer by training - graduated from IIT Bombay in 2013 with a Dual Degree (Bachelors & Masters). However, always being more interested in the math side of things, I went on to enrol as a PhD candidate in Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, part of the graduate school at New York University (NYU). 

Although it was a terribly exciting and interesting field, I found something that was even more to my liking - the clarion call of AI/ML (not to be confused with AIML, which is something I'm just getting started on) which had me drop my PhD midway. I currently work with [Atidiv](https://www.atidiv.com/) as a data scientist, and am excited to try new things with data and math, some of which I hope to share here.
